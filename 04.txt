list comprehension
  building lists out of existing lists
   [<value> for <var> in <list>]
   [5 for x in range(10)] -> [ 5,5,5... ]
   x for x .. is useless: just range(10) is the list
   [x*x for x in range(10)]
   [(x, x*x) ..] list of tuples
   [{x: x*x} ..] list of dicts
conditional 
  [<value> for <var> in <list> if <condition>]
  Java shorthand: a = a<0?0:a
    if using {}longhand, cannot assign val
  in PYthon: a = 0 if a<0 else a  
  this is usable in lc only inthe First part..<value>..it is NOT treated in the list comprehension!! it is an assigned value. you don't really need it there!
    [x if x%2=1 else 0 for x in range(10)] -> [0,1,0,3,0,5...]
range(3, 100, 3) -> all multiples of 3

generate a list of non-prime (composite number)
range(14, 100, 7)
[y for x in range(2,10) for y in range(2*x,100,x)] *contains repeats

{ c for c in s } #makes dict

def quicksort(l):
  if len(l) <= 1:
    return l
  pivot = random.choice(l)
  lower = [i for i in l if i < pivot]
  upper = [i for i in l if i > pivot]
  return quicksort(lower) + (l.count(pivot) * [pivot]) + quicksort(upper)
  
~closure~

def rep(s):
  def times(x):
    return s*x
  return times
  
rep(hello)(3)

b=rep('bye') #b is a Closure. it gets created here
b(3) -> 'byebyebye'

def repL(s):
  return lambda x, z, y #multiple args# : s*x
  
def greet():
def header(f):

g = header(greet)
#WRONG# f = header(farewell())

OR
@header
def greet():


greet = header(greet)
