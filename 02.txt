Documentmenting your data

NoSQL
    graph, document, file system

records in doc oriented databases are stored as documents
    each doc contains all the data that is associated with the given record, in key value pairs (fields)
    type non specific
    documents are put into colelctions
    docs in same collection do NOT need to have same fields
    each doc has its own Primary Key, usually generated by mongo
mongo structure
    looks like a dict
mongod is a server process running somewhere and you connect to it
    you can only run 1 at a time
        mongod
  db1            db2
collection  collection
documents    documents

$pip install pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
server = MongoClient(<IP>) #homer ip: 149.89.150.100
#if loopback: 127.0.0.1
db = server['mydb'] or db = server.mydb #both works

students = db.students #students is a collection object not a db object

!!!databases and collections are not created until a document has been added
!!!BUT you still have to declare the colls frist
students.count() #= 0

add a document:
    doc = {'name':'mlfao', 'numcats': 4, 'luckynums': [1,2,5]}
    c.insert_one( doc )
